        <p>
        I am Aaron Jay N. Gabato, an 18-year-old resident of Poblacion West, Science City of Munoz, Nueva Ecija, Philippines, born on June 1, 2002. My childhood dream was to follow in my father's footsteps and become an engineer, inspired by his own successful career in the field. However, as time passed, my interests evolved, and I discovered a deep passion for video games, which began with a PlayStation 1 gifted by my father. This love for gaming has remained a constant in my life, ultimately reshaping my aspirations. Now, my goal is to channel my passion for web development into a meaningful career within the industry. This shift reflects my determination to pursue a path that aligns with my true passions and personal growth.        </p>
